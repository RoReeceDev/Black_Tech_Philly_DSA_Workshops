//Prompt: Create an algorithm that will separate apples and oranges from a bag of unsorted mixed fruit 

//Input

//List unsorted fruits that include apples and oranges.

//Output

// A List that contained apples,
// A list that contains oranges, 
// A list that contains the unsorted remaining fruit 

//Alogrithm

//Step 1: Take the list of unsorted fruit and loop through it 
//Step 2A: Check if the fruit has a value of apple. If it does, send it to the apples list.
//Step 2B: Check if the fruit has a value of orange. If it does, send it to the oranges list.
//Step 2C: If the fruit is neither apple or orange, send it to the unsorted list.
